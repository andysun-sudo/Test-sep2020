# Test-sep2020
Engineering Stack Test September 2020
This project contains three sections, one interface of adding policyholders (Add_Policyholder.html) and one interface of adding new loss event (Add_Events.html). They linked with Python as backend using CGI. However the configuration on my laptop won't allow me to run the html with Python CGI successfully. 
I also uploaded the script soly run in Python, it takes the inputs and structure information in form of dictionary.
